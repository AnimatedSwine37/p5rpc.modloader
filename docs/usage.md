## Prerequisites

### Create a Reloaded Mod

Follow the guidance in the [Reloaded wiki](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/CreatingMods/) to create a new Reloaded mod.  

### Download Mod

If you don't have it already, download the `Persona 5 Royal Essentials` Mod.  

![DownloadMod](./images/DownloadMod.png)

### Set Dependency on P5R Essentials

In the `Edit Mod` menu (right click your mod in mods list) we're going to add `Persona 5 Royal Essentials` as a dependency.  

![AddDependency](./images/AddDependency.png)

Adding a 'dependency' to your mod will make it such that P5R Essentials will always be loaded when your mod is loaded. This is a necessary step. 

## Replacing files in CPKs

!!! info

    Files inside CPKs can be replaced by creating a folder called `P5REssentials/CPK` in your mod, and adding folders corresponding to the names of the CPKs inside those folders.

### Opening the Mod Folder

![OpenModFolder](./images/OpenModFolder.png)

Go to the folder where your mod is stored, this can be done by simply clicking the `Open Folder` button.  

### Add Some Files

Make a folder called `P5REssentials`, and inside that a folder called `CPK`.   
Inside that folder, make folder names matching the names of the `CPKs` .  

![FileRedirectorFolder](./images/CpkRedirectorFolder.png)

Placing files inside this folder will replace files in game's `EN.CPK`.  

![FileRedirectorFolder](./images/CpkRedirectorFolder2.png)

We will replace these two files to enable different button prompts ðŸ˜‡.

The contents of our mod folder would now look as follows.

```
// Mod Contents
ModConfig.json

P5REssentials
â””â”€CPK
  â””â”€EN.CPK
    â””â”€BUTTON
      â”œâ”€BUTTON_XBOX.PAK
      â””â”€BUTTONXBOXTEXINFO.DAT
```


The connectors `â””â”€` represent folders.
